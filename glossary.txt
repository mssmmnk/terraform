This is a glossary/guide for some terms used within the terraform project (and within cloud computing in general)

main : the principal file where the infraestructure will be defined.
       this file specifies the needed resources in the cloud environment, for example:
       -vpc : a isoled virtual environment within the cloud infraestructure. Offers total control under the network environment
       -cidr(classes inter-domain routing): is a method for ip address allocation and ip routing where a net is divided in small pieces(subnets)
       -instances: is a server resource provided by third-party cloud services
       -security groups : virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for instances
       -internet gateway : is a component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet
       -route tables: a set of rules that are used to determine where network traffic from your VPC instances is directed
       -elastic ip : is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing environments
       -nacls(network acess control list): additional layer of security for traffic control 
       -additional cloud services: Like S3 and blob storage (used to store data), rds and sql database (relational database services)
       -iam roles and policies: components of managing access to resources securely within cloud environments
